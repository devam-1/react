        SPOTIFY! <h3> Spotify Free lets you listen to music at normal (96 kilobits per second) or high quality (160 Kbps), and you can't adjust the bitrate beyond that. Spotify Premium adds Very High quality streaming at 320 Kbps, which can make for better, more detailed audio output if you use high-end headphones or speakers.</h3>
            YOUTUBE!  <a href="https://snobmonkey.com/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-youtube/"> free to use!</a>
